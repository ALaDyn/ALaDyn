[ALaDyn](https://github.com/ALaDyn/ALaDyn) is an open source Particle-in-cell
code, developed to simulate the fully selfconsistent particle-field dynamics
of an electromagnetic field interacting with a plasma. 
To date, main usage of the code has been carried on in simulating:

- **L**aser **W**ake**F**ield acceleration (Laser driven),

- **P**lasma **W**ake**F**ield acceleration (Beam driven),

- **T**arget **N**orma **S**heath **A**cceleration (Interaction with solid targets).


@Bug
ALaDyn code is fully maintained and tested.
Anyway, if while using it you find any bug affecting the code or if you simply
have questions, please feel free to open an issue in the [GitHub page](https://github.com/ALaDyn/ALaDyn/issues).
