`ALaDyn` (**A**cceleration by **La**ser and **Dyn**amics of charged particles) is a PIC code firstly described in *ALaDyn: A High-Accuracy PIC code for the Maxwell-Vlasov Equations*, by C. Benedetti et al., published on IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, **36** 4, 1790-1798 (2008) and then again in the update *Charge preserving high order PIC schemes*, by P. Londrillo et al., published on Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A, **620** 1, 28-35 (2010). PWFA modules have been presented in *Numerical investigation of beam-driven PWFA in quasi-nonlinear regime*, by P. Londrillo et al., published on Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A, **740** (2014).

This newer version, in part rewritten from scratch, is released as an alpha version as is, without any warranty, and will be maintained here on GitHub. A new publication is currently underway to describe progresses on this new code. If you use `ALaDyn`, you're kindly required to cite the Zenodo DOI of the latest release.

## How to build
`ALaDyn` is best built using cmake.
We support building ALaDyn on almost all sane systems, a guide will be published soon, in the meantime the appveyor and travis recipes should be clear enough on how to build the code on Windows (cygwin/WSL), Mac and Linux (all the systems that we use daily)
